```{r}
library(conflicted)
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)

library(lubridate)
library(spatialEco)
library(ambient)

R.files = list.files("../R", full.names = T)
for (f in R.files) source(f)
set.seed(1)
```

Construct a system of two villages where 200 people live in #1 and 100 live in #2. 10# of people spend half their time with another village.

```{r}
# Construct living locations
houses_1 = tibble(X = rnorm(30, 0, 40),
                  Y = rnorm(30, 0, 40))
houses_2 = tibble(X = rnorm(15, 100, 25),
                  Y = rnorm(15, 0, 25))

```
